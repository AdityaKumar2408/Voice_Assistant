# Voice_Assistant

**Overview**

This is a simple Python Voice_Assistant that utilizes speech recognition to process voice commands and perform various tasks. The assistant can respond to commands related to playing videos on YouTube, telling the current time, providing information from Wikipedia, and telling jokes. Additionally, it can perform a general web search using Google.

**Requirements**

To run this code, you'll need the following dependencies:

* Python (version 3.x)
* speech_recognition library
* pyttsx3 library
* pywhatkit library
* datetime module
* wikipedia library
* pyjokes library
* googlesearch-python library

**Usage**

* The Voice_Assistant will start listening for your voice input. Once it hears a command, it will process the audio and attempt to understand the command.

* Speak clearly and provide specific commands like:

      1."Play <song name>" to play a song on YouTube.
      2."What is the time?" to get the current time.
      3."Who is <person name>?" to fetch information from Wikipedia about the person.
      4."Tell me a joke" to hear a random programming joke.
      5.Any other general query to perform a web search using Google.
* The Voice_Assistant will respond with the appropriate action based on the command received.

* The assistant will keep running and listening for new commands until you decide to shut it down.


**Important Notes**

* The assistant may not always recognize commands accurately, so speak clearly and try to avoid background noise.

* The assistant relies on internet connectivity to perform searches, so ensure that you have a stable internet connection while running the program.

* Please be aware of the legal implications of web scraping. Ensure that you have the right to access and use the data from the websites you interact with, and always be respectful of the website's terms of service and policies.
